ABOUT
=======
LARKC Auto Query is intended to be used as a tool to automate testing of Larkc ( http://www.larkc.eu/ ) 
by creating workflows and sending queries to them.


DESCRIPTIOPN
============
LARKC Auto Query uses bash scripting and curl to connect to Larkc REST APIs, create workflows and 
sending queries to them.

The code is split into three parts: 

1. script/larkc-access-functions.sh
A library that contains functions to access Larkc REST APIs. It was built so it could be reused by
other scripts also.
Implemented functions: 
larkc_is_running - check to see if Larkc is running
larkc_submit_workflow - submits the workflow description to the platform and returns the workflow id
larkc_get_workflow_endpoint - obtains the endpoint URL of the given workflow id
larkc_delete_workflow - deletes the workflow identified by the workflow id
larkc_query_endpoint - sends a query to the given endpoint and returns the result
larkc_file_query_endpoint - sends a query, read from file, to the given endpoint and returns the result

2. script/autoquery.sh
Script that takes as arguments a "workflow directory", creates the workflow from file workflow.ttl 
and then sends the queries from "query*" or "queries*" files to the created workflow.

3. run.sh
Main script for starting Larkc Auto Query Tool.

In order for the script to work, a certain directory structure is expected. Directory 
"queries-to-execute" should contain other directories, called workflow directories. Each of these 
workflow directories must contain one file named "workflow.ttl" which should contain the workflow 
intended to be created on Larkc. It should also contain one or more files named "queries*" or 
"query*" which should contain the queries to send to the created Larkc workflow.
Files named "queries*" are assumed to contain more than one query separated by new line.
Files named "query*" are assumed to contain just one query (that can spawn on multiple lines).

For each of the found "workflow directories", a new process is executed. This process will read the
workflow.ttl file and send it to Larkc to create the workflow. Then queries will be read from the
"query*" and "queries*" files and send one after another to the created Larkc workflow.

Directory "examples" contain examples of such directory structure. Part of all of the examples 
directories can be copied into directory "queries-to-execute".


CONFIGURATION
=============
File configuration.sh is the place where LARKC Auto Query can be configured.
It allows to define larkc platform URL location and the workflows endpoint name. Endpoint name must 
match the name from workflow description files (workflow.ttl).


RUNNING
=======
LARKC Auto Query needs bash and curl in order to work. Also Larkc needs to be running.
To start it up just execute "run.sh" script.
